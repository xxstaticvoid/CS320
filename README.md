**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
To ensure my code is both functional and secure, I will put a new focus on testing early and often throughout the development process. I will use unit tests to verify that individual components behave as expected and integration tests to confirm that different parts of the system work together correctly. Tools like JUnit help automate these tests which make it easeir to maintain reliability as the code evolves. 

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
From my coursework so far I've learned that the best way is to start by gathering requirements from users or stakeholders and translating those into functional specifications / user stories. Understanding the “why” behind each feature helps ensure the software truly solves the user’s problem. During development, I tend to really favor a iterative design, where I start small, test, and then continously build on top. 

**How do I approach designing software?**
When designing software, I start with a modular and scalable code base. I break the problem into smaller, manageable components with clear responsibilities. I often use UML diagrams or simple flowcharts to visualize the system before coding. Now that I have a much more foundational understanding to testing, I will intergrating things like unit testing into the design process at regular intervals.
